                    <h2>Sleep under the Northern Lights</h2>
                    <p>Ah, the elusive Northern Lights. So many factors are at play when it comes to seeing the technicolor phenomenon—location, time of year, weather conditions—but it's hard to lose with an excursion to Finnish Lapland. The Arctic area is one of the planet's best for lights viewing, especially if you get to sleep in an igloo hotel at Kakslauttanen Arctic Resort or mobile Aurora Bubble Sled. Up your viewing chances by planning a trip between December and March.</p>

                    <h2>Climb Mount Fuji</h2>
                    <p>Solitary Mount Fuji is probably Japan's most iconic natural wonder, rising 12,388 feet above villages and reflecting on lakes' surfaces. You can get views of the landmark from many places, like Lake Kawaguchi in Fujikawaguchiko and even the Park Hyatt Tokyo, but it's the views from the mountain that give you the most bragging rights. Visit from early July to mid-September (fingers crossed for 2022) to take advantage of the official climbing season, when the designated trails and paved roads are free from snow.</p>

                    <h2>Swim through Mexico's cenotes</h2>
                    <p>Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula features a wealth of unique natural beauty, particularly when it comes to its cavernous cenotes. Floating in one of these natural sinkholes is an incredible experience, as is diving through the underground cave systems. When in Tulum, visit Dos Ojos (“Two Eyes”) to view one of the planet's most beautiful underwater sites (bonus points for water visibility), or Gran Cenote for rock formations that resemble Gothic architecture.

                    <h2>Snorkel between continents at Thingvellir National Park</h2>
                    <p>Iceland is one of the best countries in the world for adventure travel, with opportunities for everything from glacier hiking to snorkeling and diving. For the latter, head straight to Thingvellir National Park along the country's Golden Circle route, where two tectonic plates slowly pull apart at the rate of about two centimeters (0.8 inches) per year. The phenomenon results in the Silfra fissure, a stunning rift valley where travelers can snorkel or dive in impossibly clear (and cold) waters. Tour company DIVE.IS offers tours for divers and every level of snorkeler (including those with zero experience), and will snap an underwater photo of you touching two continents at the same time.</p>

                    <h2>Dive Belize's Great Blue Hole</h2>
                    <p>Known for its circular shape and strikingly deep blue color, the Great Blue Hole is a 1,000-foot-wide sinkhole in the middle of Belize's Lighthouse Reef. While an aerial shot is enough to convince anyone of its beauty, scuba divers are the ones who get to experience the wonders that lie beneath: massive, 40-foot limestone stalactites and stalagmites that formed during the last glacial period.</p>

                    <h2>Camp in Antarctica
                    </h2>
                    <p>Antarctica is truly the final frontier when it comes to adventure travel, providing untouched landscapes, unique wildlife, and more activities than you'll know what to do with (cruising, caving, and thermal spring soaking to name a few). If you can get yourself to Punta Arenas, Chile, Antarctic Logistics & Expeditions will fly you to Antarctica for three days of skiing and hiking before setting you up for a South Pole sleepover.</p>
